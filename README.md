# ChromeNotes

What can it do goes here! Make it sound fun and exciting. Woo!

Find yourself writing post-it notes or using another app to take notes when you're browsing in Chrome? Then the
ChromeNotes extension is for you! This extension enables users to save, browse, edit, and delete notes from within their
browser. Notes are sorted by creation date and are filterable by URL. Plus, notes are synced! Just sign
in with the same Chrome profile across your non-mobile devices, and you'll see them appear.
