TODO:
  - include asterisk tooltip that explains limits of sync storage and current number of notes
  - format Notes to scroll when there are too many
  - limit amount of characters each note displays unless clicked
  - if there are no notes, display "Your _____ is empty" "There's nothing here" or an image
  - include crumb breakdowns so user can see more specified content
        e.g. reddit.com (5) -> ... -> webdev (1)
        e.g. site(10) -> ... -> mens-style (1)
        e.g. nytimes.com (10) -> tech (3) -> ... -> current (1)
  - add state management to undo note deletions
